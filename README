vagrantboxes
============

The vagrantboxes module is written to be used as a tool to set up various Vagrantfile configs either from a seperat repo or stored within the file repo

The intention of this module is not to install Vagrant, and as such it will not suggest a fixed dependancy on vagrant until such time Puppetlabs make a supported Vagrant module.

The intention of this module is to provide a hook to puppet apply to role out you Vagrantfile config.

Usage
-----
 puppet apply -e "include class vagrantnboxes{ vagrantfile => 'some name'}"


To facilitate this a example Vagrantbox file is provided.
